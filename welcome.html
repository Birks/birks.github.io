        <p class="text-justify">My name is Tamás Birkás and I'm software engineering student at University of Szeged (Hungary). The purpose of this website is
            to be a collection of my projects.
            All of these works are available on GitHub for download. These projects are made in my spare time
            and some of those were school projects originally.
            They are mostly Android projects made with the official Android Studio IDE. Some of them has been abandoned
            due to lack of interest. This means they are not using the recent
            Android features and API-s.<br><br>I want to thank GitHub for letting me have this site. So welcome to my developer site and if you want to check out my projects
            then click the <b>Projects</b> link at the top of the page.</p>
