            to be a collection of my projects.
            All of these works are available on GitHub for download. These projects are made in my spare time
            and some of those were school projects originaly.
            They are mostly Android projects made with the official Android Studio IDE. Some of them has been abadoned
            due to lack of intrest. This means they are not using the newest
            Android features and API-s.<br><br>I want to thank GitHub for leting me have this site. So welcome to my developer site and if you want to check out my projects
            then click on the projects link at the top of the page.</p>
